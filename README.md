# DartinBot Framework - Quality Assurance

This repository handles comprehensive quality assurance, security validation, and compliance checking for templates that have passed development validation.

## 🎯 QA Focus

### Comprehensive Quality Validation
- **Security Scanning**: Vulnerability assessment and penetration testing
- **Compliance Validation**: Regulatory and industry standard compliance
- **Code Quality Analysis**: Advanced code quality metrics and analysis
- **Performance Profiling**: Initial performance and efficiency validation

### Quality Standards for QA
- **Security**: Zero critical vulnerabilities
- **Compliance**: 100% compliance score (GDPR, HIPAA, SOC2)
- **Code Quality**: SonarQube quality gate passing
- **Test Coverage**: Minimum 85% test coverage

2. **DAST Analysis**: Dynamic Application Security Testing
3. **Dependency Scanning**: Third-party dependency vulnerability assessment
4. **Secret Detection**: Scanning for hardcoded secrets and credentials
5. **Penetration Testing**: Simulated attack scenarios

### 2. Compliance Validation
1. **GDPR Compliance**: Data privacy and protection validation
2. **HIPAA Compliance**: Healthcare data security standards
3. **SOC2 Type II**: Security and availability controls
4. **ISO 27001**: Information security management standards
5. **PCI DSS**: Payment card industry standards (when applicable)

### 3. Code Quality Analysis
1. **SonarQube Analysis**: Comprehensive code quality metrics
2. **Technical Debt Assessment**: Code maintainability analysis
3. **Complexity Analysis**: Cyclomatic complexity and code metrics
4. **Documentation Quality**: Documentation completeness and accuracy
5. **Best Practices Validation**: Industry best practices compliance

### 4. Quality Gates (QA Stage)
